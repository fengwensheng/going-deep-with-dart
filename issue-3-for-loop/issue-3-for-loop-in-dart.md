# `for` loop in Dart

Let's go deep into how `for` loops work in Dart.

## What is a `for` loop?

There are two types of `for` loops in Dart:

1. `for ([final/var] x = N; x [<|<=|>|>=] y; x [+= y|++|--|-=])`
2. `for (final x in y)` where y is an `Iterable`

we will start off by looking at the first for loop and see what we learn!
